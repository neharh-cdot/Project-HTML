        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The life cycle of a butterfly is a fascinating process that involves several stages of growth and transformation. It is a perfect example of metamorphosis, where the organism undergoes a complete change in form during its life. The four main stages of the butterfly's life cycle are the egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly).</p>

                <h3>Stage 1: Egg</h3>
                <p>The life cycle begins when a butterfly lays its eggs on the leaves of a plant. These eggs are very small and can be found on the underside of the leaves. The egg stage typically lasts for about 3-7 days, depending on the species and environmental factors.</p>

                <h3>Stage 2: Larva (Caterpillar)</h3>
                <p>Once the egg hatches, a tiny larva (or caterpillar) emerges. The caterpillar’s primary goal is to eat and grow. It feeds on the leaves of the host plant and may molt several times as it grows larger. The larval stage can last anywhere from a few weeks to several months.</p>

            <div class="stage-text">
                <h3>Stage 3: Pupa (Chrysalis)</h3>
                <p>After the caterpillar has grown large enough, it enters the pupal stage. It sheds its skin and forms a chrysalis or pupa, where it undergoes a dramatic transformation. Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar’s body breaks down and reforms into a butterfly. This stage can last from a few weeks to several months depending on the species.</p>

            <img src="https://example.com/butterfly.jpg" alt="Adult Butterfly">
            <div class="stage-text">
                <h3>Stage 4: Adult Butterfly</h3>
                <p>After the transformation is complete, the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis. Its wings are soft and wet at first, but they dry out and harden within a few hours. The adult butterfly then begins its search for food, typically nectar from flowers. The adult butterfly will mate and lay eggs, starting the cycle again.</p>
